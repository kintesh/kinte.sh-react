        <h3>You know how they make shows?</h3>
        <p>
          Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show&apos;s called a pilot. Then they show that
          show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they&apos;re going
          to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don&apos;t, become nothing.
          She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.

        <p>
          You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste
          for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don&apos;t know exactly when we turned
          on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took
          an oath, that I&apos;m breaking now. We said we&apos;d say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn&apos;t.
          Nature is lethal but it doesn&apos;t hold a candle to man.

        <h3>Hold on to your butts</h3>
        <p>
          Your bones don&apos;t break, mine do. That&apos;s clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than
          mine. You don&apos;t get sick, I do. That&apos;s also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way
          to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem,
          we are connected, you and I. We&apos;re on the same curve, just on opposite ends.
